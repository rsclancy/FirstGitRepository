Frosty The Chicken Water Heater
==================

A Silicon Labs 8051 project that will control the temperature of a
water resevoir. The intent is to design a PID control loop that will
measure the temperature of the water and heat it to a set point
thereby keeping it from freezing in the winter. Features will include
sensing low water and too cold conditions, that if triggered will
cause an alarm. The alarm will consist of (flashing) leds and a 1000
Hz signal that will drive a piezo squawker.
